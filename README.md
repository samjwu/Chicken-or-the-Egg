# Background

A very short game (by design! it was made to be beaten within 5 minutes!) made in one week for the July Game Jam on Newgrounds. Play it on [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/806922) or [GitHub](https://samjwu.github.io/Chicken-or-the-Egg/)!

The theme was very EGGxciting. Can you guess what it was?

# About

![Screenshot](screenshot.PNG)

Chicken or the Egg is an idle clicker game where you try to (d)evolve as fast as possible from a dinosaur to a chicken (some scientists suggest that chickens evolved from dinosaurs!) by making eggs.

Get eggs by clicking on the mother or by making babies that will grow up to make more eggs!

A cool feature of the game is the "soft reset" or "prestige" system, which is achieved through the (d)evolutions and features new mothers, babies, environments, and music (which is the best part of this game in my opinion) for each (d)evolution.

The game also rewards you for hoarding or stockpiling more eggs than required for each (d)evolution by giving you bonuses to egg production (for both mothers and babies) in each new (d)evolved form.
